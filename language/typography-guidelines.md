## Typography
Typography is the vehicle that delivers content to interfaces. It sets the visual tone for the entire Watson experience. Text is largely differentiated by size and weight, keeping other properties the same or similar, differentiating only when necessary for the sake of clarity.

### Helvetica Neue for IBM
As a rule and wherever possible, use Helvetica Neue. It is the font of science and the information age, with a precision and objectivity that commands respect.  We lean on Helvetica Neue to do the hard work of conveying information, specifications and the basics. Its clean confidence makes it ideal for our product design. To ensure optimized performance for all users, IBM Watson recommends choosing no more than 4 combinations of weights and styles (light and light oblique being 2 separate combinations, for instance). For best contrast between two font weights, make sure their weights are at least 200 apart.

### Typographic Scale
IBM Design Language recommends using modular type scales to create harmonious proportions and structure, as scale creates consistency in sizing across elements. A visual type scale turns a typographic balancing act into a set ratio. As a rule of thumb, the content and user's browser size should inform type scaling choices. IBM Watson recommends choosing breakpoints at which contrast begins to interrupt readability, and scale appropriately.
