Color is a crucial component of our visual vernacular, helping to unify the look and feel of all communications. The [IBM Design Language](http://www.ibm.com/design/language/framework/visual/color.shtml) comprises a wide spectrum of colors; IBM Watson relies on a defined subset of those colors to establish its unique presence while respecting the broader IBM Design guidelines.

## Colors for Watson

The colors chosen for IBM Watson are flexible and distinguish Watson as a brand across all user experiences. The colors chosen for IBM Watson were developed using color psychology to support the Watson [brand attributes](brand-attributes.html), reinforce Watson's personality, and set the tone of each specific product.

## Choosing A Color Palette

Choose a primary color, a secondary color, and an accent color. Additional tints and shades of the chosen palette can help to unify the design. These values can add variety to a palette without additional colors. Use the IBM Design Language for a wider variety of colors, values, and neutrals.

## Applying A Color Palette

Color is a powerful communication tool to determine hierarchy on a page. Use ample white space and neutrals to create balance and to direct users' attention.
