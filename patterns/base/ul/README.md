# Unordered List

Unordered List, `<ul>`, is the base styling for a listing of items whose order is not relevant to their display

## Available Classes

Styling can be applied in the following ways:

* `.base--ul` - class
* `.base--STYLED ul` - `<ul>` tag inside a class of `.base--STYLED`
* `%base--ul` - extended through Sass
