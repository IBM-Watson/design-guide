Button, `<button>`, is an element which may serve as a trigger to an action. Submit buttons are linked to forms and push the data from the form to the server. Reset buttons will clear any inputs.

## Available Classes

Styling can be applied in the following ways:

* `.base--button` - class
* `.base--STYLED button` - `<button>` tag inside a class of `.base--STYLED`
* `%base--button` - extended through Sass
